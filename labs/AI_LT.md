# Simulating Road Sign Attacks with Adversarial Images

**Objective:**
- Understand how adversarial images can trick AI image processors into misinterpreting road signs.
- Explore the impact of such attacks on autonomous vehicles and the potential dangers involved.

## Pre-Lab Setup Instructions
- **Understanding Adversarial Attacks:**
  - Instructors should review the concept of adversarial attacks on AI systems, focusing on how small changes to an image can cause AI models to make incorrect classifications.
- **Suggested Reading:**
  - [Introduction to Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07397)
  - [Adversarial Machine Learning](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/ai/adversarial-machine-learning)
- **Print and Prepare Road Signs**
  - Print several standard road signs (e.g., stop, yield, speed limit) on high-quality paper. Ensure these signs are clear and accurately represent the real-life versions.

- **Gather Materials:**
  - Obtain small stickers or markers that can be used to slightly alter the appearance of the printed road signs.
  - Ensure you have enough notebooks and pens for students to record their observations and analysis.
- **Prepare the Classroom:**
  - Set up a space where students can view and interact with the road signs. Arrange the room so that students can work in groups to modify and analyze the signs.

## Materials Needed
- **Printed Road Signs:**
  - Standard road signs (e.g., stop, yield, speed limit) printed on paper. Use high-quality prints for clarity.
  - [Printable Road Signs Resource](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02084/us_road_symbol_signs.pdf)
- **Adversarial Stickers or Markers:**
  - Small stickers or markers that can be used to alter the appearance of the road signs slightly.
  - [Purchase them here](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=small+stickers+for+crafts) or any general stationery store.
- **Notebook and Pen:**
  - For students to record observations, hypothesize about the potential impact of the changes, and analyze the results.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Introduction (10 minutes)

- **Explain AI Image Processing:**
  - Start by introducing the concept of AI image processing in autonomous vehicles, specifically how these systems are designed to recognize and interpret road signs.
  - Discuss the importance of accurate road sign recognition for the safety and functionality of autonomous driving systems.
- **Introduce Adversarial Attacks:**
  - Explain how adversarial attacks work, where small, often imperceptible alterations to an image can trick AI systems into making incorrect classifications. Relate this to potential dangers in autonomous vehicles.

### Step 2: Road Sign Simulation (20 minutes)

- **Display Standard Road Signs:**
  - Show the students the standard printed road signs and discuss what each sign means and how it would be interpreted by an autonomous vehicle.
- **Apply Adversarial Changes:**
  - Have students apply small stickers or make slight alterations with markers to the signs. Encourage creativity while ensuring the changes are subtle enough to simulate real adversarial attacks.
  - Examples: Adding a small sticker to a stop sign that might cause an AI to interpret it as another sign, or altering a speed limit sign to confuse the AI.
- **Discuss Potential AI Misinterpretations:**
  - Facilitate a discussion on how these small changes might confuse an AI system into misinterpreting the sign (e.g., a slight change to a stop sign might make it look like a yield sign to an AI system).

### Step 3: Analysis and Discussion (20 minutes)

- **Group Analysis:**
  - Break students into small groups to analyze how the changes they made to the signs could affect an AIâ€™s ability to correctly interpret them.
  - Have each group hypothesize the potential impact on an autonomous vehicle if it were to encounter these altered signs on the road.
- **Present Findings:**
  - Each group presents their findings, discussing the specific changes they made, how they think an AI would interpret these changes, and the potential dangers involved.
- **Discussion on Defense Mechanisms:**
  - Conclude with a discussion on how AI systems can be trained or designed to be more resilient to such adversarial attacks. Explore ideas such as training with more diverse datasets, incorporating multiple sensors, and using robust AI models.

## Discussion Points
- How do small changes to a road sign affect its readability for AI systems?
- What are the potential dangers of AI systems misinterpreting road signs?
- What strategies can be used to make AI systems more resilient to adversarial attacks?

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Students will gain a deeper understanding of how AI image processing works and how it is applied in autonomous vehicles.
- Students will learn about the concept of adversarial attacks and how even small changes can significantly impact AI performance.
- Students will engage in critical thinking about the importance of secure and reliable AI systems in real-world applications.
