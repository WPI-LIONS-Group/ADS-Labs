# Cyber Attack Hands-On Simulation and Role-Playing

### Recap and Sharing (15 minutes)

- Review the basics of cybersecurity and autonomous vehicles.
- Students share their homework research findings on real-life examples of cybersecurity attacks.

### Simulation Setup (20 minutes)

- **Introduce the Simulation:** Explain that students will simulate a remote cyber attack on an autonomous vehicle and then defend against it. Discuss how remote access points (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular connections) can be exploited.
- **Roles and Scenarios:**
  - **Remote Hackers:** Attempt to infiltrate the vehicleâ€™s system remotely.
  - **Vehicle Owners:** Represent the users of the autonomous vehicle.
  - **Cybersecurity Experts:** Develop and implement security measures.
- **Preparation:**
  - Set up a simple mock-up of an autonomous vehicle using a cardboard cutout.
  - Use string or yarn to create a "network" around the vehicle, representing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other remote access points.
  - Use index cards or small paper pieces to represent data packets and potential vulnerabilities.

### Simulation Activity (50 minutes)

- **Create and Simulate Remote Attacks:**
  - **Group Formation:** Divide students into two main groups: remote hackers and defenders.
  - **Brainstorming:**
    - **Remote Hackers:** Use markers and colored paper/sticky notes to design their attack methods, such as sending fake Wi-Fi signals or creating malicious data packets.
    - **Defenders:** Use large sheets of paper to brainstorm and draw their security measures, such as firewalls, encryption, and secure authentication methods.
- **Role-Play Simulation:**
  - **Round 1:**
    - **Hackers:** Attempt their attack by placing their "malicious data packets" (index cards) into the network (string/yarn) around the vehicle.
    - **Defenders:** Observe and take notes on how the attack is carried out.
  - **Round 2:**
    - **Defenders:** Implement their security measures (e.g., placing "firewall" paper barriers on the network, using encryption symbols on data packets).
    - **Hackers:** Attempt to bypass these defenses.
  - **Debrief:** After each round, gather all students to discuss:
    - What happened during the attack?
    - Which vulnerabilities were exploited?
    - How effective were the defenses?

### Reflection and Discussion (25 minutes)
- **Class Discussion:**
  - Key takeaways from the simulation.
  - Specific vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles that can be exploited remotely.
  - Effective security measures to defend against remote attacks.
- **Reflection:** Students write a short reflection on what they learned, the challenges they faced, and how they can apply this knowledge to other technologies.

### Conclusion (10 minutes)
- **Review:** Summarize the key points covered in the simulation and discussion.
- **Q&A:** Open the floor for final questions or comments.
