# Hands-On Cybersecurity Hack and Defense for an Autonomous Vehicle

**Grade Level:** 9th - 10th Grade

**Subject:** Computer Science / Cybersecurity

**Duration:** 2 class periods (90 minutes each)

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the fundamentals of cybersecurity.
- Explore vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicle systems.
- Create and simulate cybersecurity hacks and defenses.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills to propose and implement security measures.

**Materials Needed:**
- Printed handouts with lesson content and simulation instructions.
- Role-play cards for different roles in the simulation (e.g., hacker, vehicle owner, cybersecurity expert).
- Scenario scripts for guided role-play.
- Paper, markers, and large sheets for diagram drawing and brainstorming.
- Props (e.g., cardboard cutouts) to represent the vehicle, key fob, and other elements in the simulation.

## Day 1: Introduction to Cybersecurity and Autonomous Vehicles

### Introduction (15 minutes)

- **Icebreaker Discussion:**
  - What do you know about autonomous vehicles?
  - What is cybersecurity?
  - Have you heard about any cybersecurity incidents related to cars?
- **Objective Overview:** Explain the lesson objectives and activities for the next two days.

### Lesson Content (30 minutes)

- **Presentation:**
  - Define key terms: cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, key fob sensor.
  - Discuss the importance of cybersecurity in modern technology.
  - Explain how key fob sensors work and their role in vehicle security.
- **Case Study:** Present a real-life case study of a cybersecurity attack on a vehicle (e.g., the Jeep Cherokee hack in 2015). Discuss how the attack was carried out and its impact.

### Group Activity (30 minutes)

- **Divide students into small groups.**
- **Discussion:** Each group discusses potential vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles, focusing on communication systems (e.g., key fobs, GPS), software, and physical security.
- **Presentation:** Each group shares their findings with the class.

### Homework (15 minutes)

- **Research Assignment:** Ask students to research one real-life example of a cybersecurity attack on any technology and prepare to share their findings in the next class.

## Day 2: Hands-On Simulation and Role-Playing

### Recap and Sharing (15 minutes)

- **Review:** Recap the previous day's lesson.
- **Student Sharing:** Students share their homework research findings.

### Simulation Setup (20 minutes)

- **Introduce the Simulation:** Explain that students will create and simulate cybersecurity hacks on an autonomous vehicle through a key fob sensor and then defend against them.
- **Roles and Scenarios:** Assign roles (hacker, vehicle owner, cybersecurity expert) and provide role descriptions and objectives.

### Simulation Activity (50 minutes)

- **Set Up the Scene:** Use props to create a simple mock-up of an autonomous vehicle and a key fob.
- **Create and Simulate Hacks:**
  - Divide students into two main groups: hackers and defenders.
  - Hackers brainstorm and develop their own methods to hack the autonomous vehicle via the key fob (e.g., signal interception, cloning the key fob).
  - Defenders brainstorm and develop security measures to protect against these hacks.
- **Role-Play Simulation:**
  - **Round 1:** Hackers execute their hack while defenders observe.
  - **Round 2:** Defenders implement their security measures and hackers attempt to bypass them.
  - **Debrief:** After each round, discuss what happened, the vulnerabilities exploited, and the effectiveness of the defenses.

### Reflection and Discussion (25 minutes)

- **Class Discussion:**
  - Key takeaways from the simulation.
  - Ideas for improving autonomous vehicle security.
  - Vulnerabilities in other technologies.
- **Reflection:** Students write a short reflection on what they learned, the challenges they faced, and how they can apply this knowledge.

### Conclusion (10 minutes)

- **Review:** Summarize the key points covered in both lessons.
- **Q&A:** Open the floor for final questions or comments.

## Assessment
- Participation in group discussions and activities.
- Presentation of research findings.
- Investigate and report on the latest advancements in autonomous vehicle technology and their security measures.
